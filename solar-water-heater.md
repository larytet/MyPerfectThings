My Perfect Solar Water Heater

* Reports temperature at three different levels on the wireless display
* Heating algotightm for the electric heating with tight hysteresis and optimized/configurable cycle. Options: fast, efficient, top only and so on
* In the morning and eventing when I open the tap I get the hot water immediately - requires a pump in the mains
* Real-time analysis of the runoff water and collection of the clean water in a separate bin. I estimate that close to half of the tap water goes down the pipes clean.
* Circulation of the hot water via the floor heating system when there is too much of it
* Insert an "umbrella" into the heater and separate the top 3rd from the rest of the heater. Ensure that there is a small hole in the top of the umbrella.
* Use "slapping" (sound) device to conduct current temperature from the inside of the hearter to the outside sensor.

* http://www.pakahom.com/ - they inist that there is a patent. I recall that at least one construction company (in Netanya?) about 20 years ago installed a solenoid valve(s) in their project. Around 2005 I installed a normally closed valve in my home in Kfar Yona. I started by using the timer to control the valve. In the I opened the valve when I turned the electric heater off. There is also a project I did at Netanya Academic College around 2005-2010. I doubt that a patent is enforceable.
