Create a monitoring system for a small herd (under 50 animals) where an animal costs $150.

The scalable solution contains 360 degree camera, sound sensors, light reflecting tag for every animal (optional), AI. 

The systen can employ a bright light source or AM radio to signal the herd owner that something is wrong. Such light source 
can be registered automatically. The distance is 40-80 miles. The registration device (a repeater or a final destination) 
maps the signal, forwards the alarm using light or any mobile network. 

Quesiton:
* Typical weather conditions?
* Is the topogrpahy mostly flat?
* What is a typical distance between herds?
* Size of the area  occupied by the herd?
* Number of animals in a herd?
