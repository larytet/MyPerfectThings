I imagine an automatic or semi-automatic refactoring software. This advanced profiler/compiler analyzes the code structure, followes the thread life cycle, 
maps the hot regions. Such a tool could help the containerization process. Beyond that this tool could help refactoring the code. 
I think that a relatively small refactoring of the code could lead to better utilization of the cloud benefits. 

* Open source framework
* Generic approach 
* Multiple programming languages

The target market is large legacy software products, mainly in-house applications which could benefit from moving to the cloud. Some examples: financial sector, public services.
