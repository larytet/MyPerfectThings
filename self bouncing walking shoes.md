Mechanical running shoes contain a spring and have electromagnetic assistance. On every step the assistant 
forms a magnetic field tighting the spring attached to the bottom of the shoes. When the shoes touches the
ground the assistant releases the spring. The spring bounces off the ground pushing the foot up. 

The goal is faster walking at cost of a bit less of balance. Every step ends up as a small jump thanks to 
the releasing spring.

The shoes microcontroller has a `break in` mode when the assistance slowly increases. The spring itself is
hard, and doesn't provide much of bounce by itself. 

The shoe allows two ways of customization. One way is electronicly limit the assistance. The second way via 
a tighteing screw, or a set of screws.

The bouncing spring can be hydraulic. Conceptually the shoe is the reverse of power harvesting footwear. 

The microntroller relying on an accelerometer/altimeter/pressure sensors/etc registers movement and speed 
(in several dimensions, depending on capability)
to measure impact and weight distribution adapting the timing and power of the provided on every stemp assistance.
