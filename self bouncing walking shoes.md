# Introduction


![Bouncing running shoes](resources/bouncing-shoes.jpg  )

Mechanical running shoes contain a spring and an electromagnetic assistance system. With every step, the assistant creates a magnetic field that tightens the spring attached to the bottom of the shoes. When the shoes touch the ground, the assistant releases the spring, which bounces off the ground and propels the foot up.

The goal of this design is to increase walking or running speed at the cost of a slight decrease in balance. With each step, the spring's release creates a small jump.

The shoe's microcontroller has a "break-in" mode that slowly increases the assistance provided. The spring itself is hard and doesn't provide much bounce on its own.

The shoe allows for two types of customization. The first is electronic limiting of the assistance, while the second is via tightening screws or a set of screws.

The bouncing spring can also be hydraulic, making this shoe the reverse of power harvesting footwear.

The microcontroller relies on an accelerometer, altimeter, pressure sensors, etc. to register movement and speed in multiple dimensions, depending on its capability. This allows it to measure impact and weight distribution, adapting the timing and power of the provided assistance on every step.
