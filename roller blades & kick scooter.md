Going uphill is tough. Gradient more than 15 degree on a hot summer day turns a joyful gliding into hard work on the verge of impossible.

My perfect roller blades have one electric wheel, small battery, accelerometers and CPU. The roller blades can sense the gradient, what leg is doing a push, at what angle, and what wheel has traction. At exact the right moment the CPU triggers  5% or 10% acceleration depending the gradient. 

Important:
 * Overall weight 
 * Safety 
 * Convenience
 
The electric wheels will add ~300g to the weight of the boots. I probably want to charge batteries when going downhill if it reduces the weight of the batteries.

The push supplied by the motor should be soft and at exactly the right moment when I am pushig the boot by myself. 

No wires, no charging ports (wireless charging?), simple to replace/remove the battery and save weight. Would be nice to be able to configure the ratios. Allow break-in/learning mode for first 3-5km when the system learns the skills of the operator and self adjusts slowly and safely.

Off road electric roller blades is another interestig idea. Is it possible to make wide, but light wheels which still can perform like roller blades? See "Skopinski off-road rollerblades", "Powerslide Metropolis SUV "
