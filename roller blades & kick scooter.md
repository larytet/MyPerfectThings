Going uphill can be challenging, especially on a hot summer day with a gradient of more than a few degrees. What was once a joyful glide can quickly turn into strenuous and seemingly impossible work.

To address this issue, I've designed a pair of rollerblades with one electric wheel, a small battery, accelerometers, and a CPU. The rollerblades are equipped with sensors that can detect the gradient, which leg is pushing, at what angle, and which wheel has traction. At the precise moment, the CPU triggers 5-10% acceleration, depending on the gradient.

When designing the rollerblades, safety, convenience, and overall weight were important considerations. The electric wheels will add approximately 300g to the weight of the boots, so I may need to charge the batteries when going downhill to reduce their weight. The push supplied by the motor should be soft and at exactly the right moment when I am pushing the boot by myself.

To keep things simple, I want to avoid using wires and charging ports. Instead, I'm exploring options such as wireless charging, simple battery replacement, and weight savings. It would also be nice to have the ability to configure the ratios and support a break-in/learning mode for the first 3-5km, where the system slowly and safely adjusts to the operator's skills.

I've been inspired by products such as RazErblades, which has similar features, as well as off-road electric rollerblades like Skopinski and Powerslide Metropolis SUV. I'm also interested in products like Moonwalkers by Shift Robotics, which target faster walking
