If I feel that this is a bad day I want to be able to buy an life insurance for the following 8 hours. I send SMS, get response while I finish my cup of coffee and ready to go out.
The hourly rate for such insurance can be 10x or 20x  more than a typical life insurance. This is Ok becuase I am not going to buy it every day. 

Thanks to the smartphone we can make sure by recording audio, GPS and accelerometer that insurance company covers only legetimate claims.
