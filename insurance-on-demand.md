If I feel that I’m having a bad day, I want the option to purchase life insurance for the next eight hours. I could send an SMS and receive a response while I finish my cup of coffee and get ready to go out. The hourly rate for such insurance might be 10 to 20 times higher than typical life insurance. That’s acceptable because I’m not planning to buy it every day.

Thanks to smartphones, we can ensure that the insurance company only covers legitimate claims by recording audio, GPS data, and accelerometer readings.
