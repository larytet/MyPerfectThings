I often use my kick scooter when shopping for groceries and basics. I hook the 3,4 large IKEA bags - 50-60 pounds at times - and push the scooter as usual. This is very fast and convenient.

Shopping trolleys is apparently a serious business in Europe. See [shopping trolleys on Amazon.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=sr_nr_n_2?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A11052681%2Cn%3A%213147411%2Cn%3A392546011%2Cn%3A10707781%2Cn%3A2722825031%2Cn%3A2722827031&bbn=2722825031&sort=price-desc-rank&ie=UTF8&qid=1495208894&rnid=2722825031). 
In the large European cities where many families do not have a car at all or park a car in the parking lots far 
from home a shopping trolley can often be seen. A trolley is not an exclusive attribute of grand moms anymore. 
There are producers out there who attempt to redefine a trolley  - see, for example [Hook and Go](http://www.hookandgo.com/) trolley, [Tura](http://amzn.eu/b110UiD), [Royal](http://amzn.eu/6igbzv2)

The existing trolleys are clunky, not reliable things. The market is highly fragmented. A large company with 
two or three well positioned products can conquer the market completely.
