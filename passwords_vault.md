A ring on the finger or a watch which keeps the passwords. The ring surface is divided by 8 regions. There is a small diode 
in the ring surface. The user shall orient the ring in a specific way and brush different sides of the ring 
in a specific order. At this point ring "opens". There can be more than one virtuall wallet in the ring which opens 
by different 
sets of strokes. After a ring wallet opens touch of ony of the regions will scroll the passwords in 
one of the 8 banks and project them on any surface. 


Theoretical complexity of a wallet password:

*  16 possible positions around the finger 
*  8 angles in the vertical plane 
*  number of strokes in a ring segment
*  tap or brush
*  8 segments for the strokes


Alternatives:

*  Cryptocurrency wallets like Trezor (starts from insane $99)
*  Cryptosteel ($99)
