I was thinking that end-to-end encrypted chat application could use SMS as an underlying protocol
We can package text to as a readable SMS with actual English words

Such service will be very hard to block

We can transform text to  a readable SMS with actual English words
The transform itself can be trivial. A user generates a dictionary which maps all possible trigrams to English words
The dictionary ~2.5MB and every endpoint will have to store a map for every connection
Is there anything like this on the market?
We can add an initial handshake as well where user identify themselves using unique avatars sent by SMS again


Business model wise? I have no idea
Telegram apparently makes lot of money
Will look great in the CV
Donatoons?
Bounties?
We can sell addons like wallets, e-mail application
With a little effort we can generate syntactically correct sentences in any language 

in yet another approach we can use actual phone calls to deliver the information. A user sends knocking first to notify that a special phone call is coming. After that the user establishes the phone call and sends the encrypted data like a facsimile. A network of interconnected devices can allow reasonably anonymous distribution of the content betwen nodes.
