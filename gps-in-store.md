Often I spend time looking for stuff in large department stores or supermarkets. 
I understand that the idea is that a client browse through the long rows and make impulsive purchases. It annoys me. 
The store could install a couple of GPS translators with very precise coordinates and provide an application which
calculates the best route given the list of items.

Alternatively a map can be pushed via BlueTooth to a dedicated applications running on a smartphone when the client 
enters the store. The exact location can be calculated using accelerometers and gyroscopers in the cell phone. 
Additionally image recognition software can provide some tips and improve precision of location.
