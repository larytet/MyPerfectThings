Often I spend time looking for stuff in large department stores or supermarkets. 

I understand that the idea is that a client browses through the long rows and make impulsive purchases. It annoys me. 
The store could install a couple of GPS translators with very precise coordinates and provide an application which
calculates the best route given the list of items.

Alternatively a map can be pushed via BlueTooth to a dedicated applications running on a smartphone when the client 
enters the store. The exact location can be calculated using accelerometers and gyroscopers in the cell phone. 
Additionally image recognition software can provide some tips and improve precision of location. 

My smartphone has enough accelerometers and cameras to figure out my location respective to the entry to the store, 
upload the location to the cloud. The data collected in the cloud can be used to monetize the service.
