Many contracts, for example rent agreements, follow the same rules. I would like to 
see a system which generates the contract according to options I choose. 
The system runs possible scenarious - a dry run - and shows possible 
outcomes when this or that point of 
the agrreement is breached. Would be nice to have probabilities to win the case 
in the court of law and links to the similar cases.
