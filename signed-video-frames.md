Video and audio content can be signed frame by frame using one or more private keys. 
For example, a video camera can sign every frame with it's own private key, private key of the 
operator (CNN) and an one time key of the White House. 

A large content distributor like Youtube can check the key fingerprint, find the key in the publuc data base,
enforce content filtering. The distributor can mark the stream as "trusted" and add metadata like place/date/source of the 
media.
