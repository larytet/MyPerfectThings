The business idea is to cover streets with tents made of solar panels and sell the generated electricity. This concept is particularly effective in cities where peak demand for 
air conditioning coincides with 2 PM, maximizing the utility of solar energy during high consumption periods. By utilizing the city budget for maintenance, the street coverings remain in 
good condition, ensuring their longevity and effectiveness.

One significant benefit of this idea is providing shade for streets that run east to west. This shade can help reduce the heat island effect in urban areas, lowering overall 
temperatures and decreasing the reliance on air conditioning systems, further conserving energy. Additionally, the shade can reduce the incidence of skin cancer by protecting 
pedestrians from direct sunlight, promoting public health.

The shaded streets create a more comfortable environment for walking, encouraging more people to engage in outdoor activities and increasing foot traffic for local businesses. 
This increased foot traffic can boost the local economy, creating a vibrant, bustling community atmosphere. The project aligns with sustainable development goals, offering an innovative 
solution to urban heat, energy consumption, and public health concerns.

Moreover, generating electricity close to where the demand exists minimizes energy loss during transmission and distribution, making the energy supply more efficient and reliable. This 
localized generation meets the immediate energy needs of the surrounding area, ensuring that the power is utilized effectively. By leveraging renewable energy sources and enhancing city 
infrastructure, this idea presents a forward-thinking approach to urban planning and sustainability.
