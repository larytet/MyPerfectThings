# Lights

The problem is that I see the lamp above the next table. Usually the lamps are hidden inside of niches. Here, in the new office the lights float above the head. I see the light atop in my peripheral vision unless I look down or wear a hood. Is it possible to pull the lights higher and/or shade the lights?

# AC

Apparently it is impossible to change the direction of the air flow. I feel how the cold air dries my eyes. My hands are getting uncomfortably cold. Dry and cold. Am I dead? Am I dying? Oh, I get it - this is AC. Usually the AC openings can be directed or partially closed. Not it in this case. Should I cover the outlets with nylon? Should I wear a full face motorcycle helmet and winter gloves? Good distribution of the cold air is tricky and expensive to do. The installation reminds me walkin coolers and London tube. Meanwhile a hood almost saves the day.

# Open space

In my case this is a fairly large, completely open space without any walls. I hear a small talk in the opposite corner 20 meters from me. I am  not sure if this was the plan. There is background noise all the time. I imagine that some people more sensitive to the surrounding noise than others. I suspect that there is a badly hidden hate of open spaces in the Israeli hitech. If I am right it is going to be harder to fill positions especially by old hands. Who needs old buggers anyway?
