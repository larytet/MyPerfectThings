# Lights

The problem is that I see the lamp above the next table. This is a nice, strong 3 meters long lamp with good light distribution. The lamp is bright. Usually the lamps are hidden inside niches. Here, in the new office the lights float above the head. I see the light atop in my peripheral vision unless I look down or wear a hood. Is it possible to pull the lights higher and/or shade the lights? I am gald you asked. Not in this case. I personally would turn the ligh off. I am strange. I know that I am strange. I do not dare to raise the question. I have a hoodie.

# AC

Apparently it is impossible to change the direction of the air flow. I feel how the cold air dries my eyes. My hands are getting uncomfortably cold. Dry and cold. Am I dead? Am I dying? Oh, I get it - this is AC. Usually the AC openings can be directed or partially closed. Not it in this case. Should I cover the outlets with nylon? Should I wear a full face motorcycle helmet and winter gloves? Good distribution of the cold air is tricky and expensive to do. The installation reminds me walkin coolers and London tube. Meanwhile a hood almost saves the day.

# Open space

In my case this is a fairly large, completely open space without any walls. I hear a small talk in the opposite corner 20 meters from me. I am  not sure if this was the plan. There is background noise all the time. I imagine that some people more sensitive to the surrounding noise than others. I suspect that there is a badly hidden hate of open spaces in the Israeli hitech. If I am right it is going to be harder to fill positions especially by old hands. Who needs old buggers anyway?

# A patio

There is a small open sky patio in the middle of the office. I estimate the April temperatures exceeding 30 degrees. There is a heap of puffs on the patio waiting for the winter rains. It is not an easy choice between the patio and the AC inside. The life is void of easy choices.
