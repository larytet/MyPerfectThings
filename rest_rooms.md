Why the size of the rest rooms in office buildings is the same for men and women? 
Ususally we know for every floor how many men and women work there. It is very rare that the ratio is 50/50
In the shopping malls, theaters, airports there is often a line of women. I would think that after so many years architects
could collect some statisitcs and divide the available space for the facilities in an efficient way.


Lot of links on the Net related to the topic. Some legisaltion efforts as well
