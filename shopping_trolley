I often use my kick scooter when shopping for groceries and basics. 

Shopping trolleys is apparently a serious business in Europe. See shopping trolleys on Amazon.uk. 
In the large European cities where many families do not have a car at all or park a car in the parking lots far 
from home a shopping trolley can often be seen. A trolley is not an exclusive attribute of grand moms anymore. 
There are producers out there who attempt to redefine a trolley  - see, for example "Hook and Go Urban Trolley". 

The existing trolleys are not reliable, clunky things. The market is highly fragmented. A large company with 
two or three well positioned products can conquer the market completely.
