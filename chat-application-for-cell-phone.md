End-to-end encrypted chat application could use SMS as an underlying protocol

We can transform text to  a readable SMS with actual English words
The transform itself can be trivial. A user generates a dictionary which maps all possible trigrams to English words
The dictionary ~2.5MB and every endpoint will have to store a map for every connection
We can add an initial handshake as well where user identify themselves using unique avatars sent by SMS again
Such service will be very hard to block.
