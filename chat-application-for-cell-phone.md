End-to-end encrypted chat application could use SMS as an underlying protocol

We can transform text messages to readable SMS messages with actual English words.

The transform itself can be trivial. A user generates a dictionary which maps all possible trigrams to English words. The dictionary ~2.5MB and every endpoint will have to store a map for every connection

In yet another approach we can use actual phone calls to deliver the information. A user sends knocking first to notify that a special phone call is coming. After that the user establishes the phone call and sends the encrypted data like a facsimile 

We can add an initial handshake as well where users identify themselves using unique avatars delivered by SMS

Such service will be very hard to block.
