My perfect car radio

* When switching a channel I get the sound immediately - less than 20ms
* Prefetch the signal and filter the ads out. Play one of the preconfigured sources instead of ads or mute. Supports crowd source ads filtering.
* Radio shall rememeber which sources I prefer at specific hours  
* Allows to mix 2 channels - dual channel radio and BT connection - I want to be able to hear navigation program and radio in the same time. Second channel can be AUX, BT, etc.
* I do not need any buttons, a low latency touch sensitive display will do
* Always show correct local time, time zone, day savings time - all is automatic and easily configurable.
* Recognise speach and lower the volume if somebody talks 
* Automatically adapt the volume to the noise conditions
* Keep the station on by switching automatically to different band when travelling (search for the bands if neccessary)
* Applicaton for a cell phone which does the same - FM radio + full functionality
* A USB-FM adapter for a cellphone which broadcasts the radio. 



Business model - sell to a large car maker or radio station,
