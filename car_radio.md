My ideal car radio would have the following features:

* Channels switch instantly, with a delay of less than 20ms
* The radio should prefetch the signal and filter out ads, playing a preconfigured source instead or muting altogether. Crowd-sourced ad filtering support is also desirable.
* The radio should remember which sources I prefer at specific times of day
* It should be possible to mix two channels, using a dual channel radio and Bluetooth connection. I want to be able to hear the navigation program and radio at the same time. The second channel can be AUX, Bluetooth, etc.
* No buttons are necessary; a low-latency, touch-sensitive display will suffice.
* Always show the correct local time, time zone, and daylight savings time, which should be automatic and easily configurable.
* The radio should recognize speech and lower the volume if someone is speaking.
* The volume should automatically adapt to the noise conditions.
* The station should stay on by switching automatically to different bands when traveling (searching for the bands if necessary).
* An application for a cellphone/car software that performs the same function, including FM radio and full functionality.
* A USB-FM adapter for a cellphone that broadcasts the radio.

As for the business model, one possibility is to sell the radio to a large car maker or radio station.

However, there are some limitations to the no-ads feature, as individual channels have their own ads and may not be willing to cooperate. Some channels may charge an additional fee of $20-$30 per month to provide ad-free listening, and even if they all worked together, it would still cost around $10 per month.
