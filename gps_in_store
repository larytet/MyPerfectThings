Often I spend time looking for stuff in large department stores or supermarkets. 
I understand that the idea is that a client browse through the long rows and make impulsive purchases. It annoys me. 
The store could install a couple of GPS translators with very precise coordinates and provide an application which
calculates best route given the list of items.
