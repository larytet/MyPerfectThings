Create a monitoring system for a small herd (under 50 animals) where an animal costs $150.

The scalable solution contains 360 degree camera, sound sensors, an optional light reflecting tag for every animal, AI. 

The system can employ a bright light source, AM radio, satellite communication to signal the herd owner that 
something is wrong. Such light source can be registered automatically. The distance is 40-80 miles. 
The registration device (a repeater or a final destination) maps the signal, forwards the alarm using light 
or any mobile network. 

Pricing:

* Ongoing maintenance costs should be below 1-2% of the small herd sale price - under $100/year.
* Initial cost should be below 1-2% of the initial business spendings

Quesiton:

* Typical weather conditions?
* Is the topogrpahy mostly flat?
* What is a typical distance between herds?
* Size of the area  occupied by the herd? can be 10s of miles, this one is a hard to crack issue
* Number of animals in a herd? 100s to 1000s
