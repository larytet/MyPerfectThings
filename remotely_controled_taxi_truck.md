Assorted ideas related to the trucks:

*  We need to deliver high quality video only for the area where the driver has his eyes on. 
*  We shall ensure under 5ms latency between recognition of a saccade and displaying a high resolution image in the right place. 
*  Under 5ms roundtrip latency is not realistic in the modern generally available IP networks (microwaves here?). 
*  The car can record 360 degrees view in high resolution, but send only low resolution stream for all or most areas.
*  We want to minimize the network latency and impact of the network congestion. One of the ways to do this is to require 100% visibility for the microwave transmitters. 
*  Semi-autonomous driving will help to reduce "down time" when the network is not available.
*  We can organize trains of semi-autonomous trucks controlles by a single driver sitting in the leading truck. This approach removes network from the equation.
*  We can employ control centers along the busy interstates - every 200km or so - and switch the remote control over the truck between the centers. 


Taxi is tricky - most of the driving happens in the city. Network is congested or unavailable, network latency is high. 
Microwave is not a good solution for the city as well.

*  Agreeements with the cellular providers can resolve some of the QoS problems. 
*  Dedicated marking on roads, dedictaed lanes which simplify the work for semi-autonomous cars.
