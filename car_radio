My perfect car radio

* When switching a channel I get the sound immediately - less than 20ms
* Prefetch the signal and filter the ads out. Play one of the preconfigured sources instead of ads or mute
* Radio shall rememeber which sources I turn prefer at specific hours  
* Allows to mix 2 channels
